# IDEA SCRATCH PAD

* Allow static initialization of fields using literals, e.g. `.field myInt:I = 0x42`
* Fixed several problems with looking up inherited fields
* Better merging of states from called methods
* Better exception handling - implement `throw` and `move-exception`
* Improved correctness for `instance-of` and `check-cast` ops
* Improved correctness for `java.lang.reflect.Field.get()` emulated method


find all "?" and replace with common type unknkown


// TODO: https://github.com/CalebFenton/simplify/issues/8
add tests and feature for moving exception from parent op
  move-exception op
implement the throw op also
  add some tests
also fix invoke op for getting graph of invoked method
  peekThrowRegister() see if it's null


run instance-of tests
can you do primitive instanceof primitive?
  primitive instance of object? (probably)

add documentation


Debugger
  next / previous(!)
  show local code
  set breakpoints
    method address
    line number
    on field access
  show vm info
    loaded classes
    stack trace
  show method state info
    registers
  provide method parameters as serialized objects

Graphing
  save control flow / execution flow graph before or after optimization
  show line numbers and other debug info

Save Progress
  on VM finalize, or when exiting, serialize graphs (perhaps gson)
  --resume <directory with json graphs>

Theading
  Because why not.

Hygene
  move sideeffect out of op and into node
    op shared between all nodes at address, should record sideeffect per execution

  smalivm shouldn't require trove
    remove arrays and regular lists / sets instead
    primitive unboxing probably isn't that bad

  remove array data payloads that are unreferenced
    Obfuscated example does this in reflected field lookups


Profiling Feature
  record each method descriptor and the number of times it was called

  filter for only method descriptors which have a pattern

  record only methods that failed, methods that could be whitelisted

Making Hooking easier.

Emulate
  System.exit() to halt the execution path

  Ljava/lang/reflect/Method;->invoke(Ljava/lang/Object;[Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
  invoke ourselves or run emulated method

Android class lifecycle initialization
  sometimes it can be assumed onCreate has been called
  or just give a list of methods to be called before whatever else

  simplify 7604399 -it 'PornApplication;->i2c1cqop3faop3cdhokggmd97ce\(\)'
  ArrayLists are initialized in onCreate, but since that's not known, everything fails

  MethodVisitor interface
  SimpleMethodVisitor - executes each method in arbitrary order
  AndroidLifecycleAwareMethodVisitor


Emulate / spoof stack traces - requires call stack in context or similar
  new-instance v1, Ljava/lang/Exception;
  invoke-direct {v1}, Ljava/lang/Exception;-><init>()V
  invoke-virtual {v1}, Ljava/lang/Exception;->getStackTrace()[Ljava/lang/StackTraceElement;

  invoke-virtual {v1}, Ljava/lang/StackTraceElement;->getMethodName()Ljava/lang/String;
  move-result-object v2
  invoke-direct {v0, v2}, Ljava/lang/StringBuffer;-><init>(Ljava/lang/String;)V
  invoke-virtual {v1}, Ljava/lang/StackTraceElement;->getClassName()Ljava/lang/String;

  invoke-static {}, Ljava/lang/Thread;->currentThread()Ljava/lang/Thread;
  move-result-object v2
  invoke-virtual {v2}, Ljava/lang/Thread;->getStackTrace()[Ljava/lang/StackTraceElement;


sandbox/hubert/hubert_sample.apk -it 'Lcom/i_manager/ajroute/c;->a\(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/Boolean;Ljava/lang/Integer;\)Ljava/lang/Integer;' -v
has this, which should be considered dead, needs to be specifically white listed
v0 is "assigned" since it's an instance and could have changed, but v0 is never used
    #@1f
    invoke-virtual {v0}, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;->toString()Ljava/lang/String;



During execution, the context has no awareness of the call stack. Knowing these things allows for:
  1.) illegal access checks on fields, right now, no way to tell if the field is in the same class as the current method
  2.) contextualized exception throwing with stack trace
* update - execution context of first op in method has callerContext and callerAddress, which can be traced back up to rebuild call stack

  get stack trace, first element
  from inside a method that's being optimized from main
  the call stack *should* be ambiguous
  but if it's not, could give away it's being virtually executed
  *get first element would be a string, that would get constantized during optimization


wasRegisterRead unit test possibility!
# make sure v0 is not removed
const/4 v2, 0x5
invoke-static {v2}, Ljava/lang/Integer;->valueOf(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;
move-result v0
move-object v1, v0
invoke-static {v1}, Ldoes/not/exist;->howdy(Ljava/lang/Integer;)V

# make sure v0 IS REMOVED

assumeMaxUnknown for invokeop wont work for LocalInstance.isInitialized == false, add tests
boolean isInitializing = methodDescriptor.contains(";-><init>(") && ((value instanceof UninitializedInstance));

test aput for non-Number values, e.g. boolean and character into an int array, but see if dalvik handles it properly first


simple test
  throw an exception and catch it

inheritence test
  throw a child exception and see if caught by exception parent

complex inheritence
  throw a child exception, catch parent and grandparent and make sure parent handles

finally test
  simple value set + test

unhandled exception + finally test
  throw exception but make sure finally value set

handled exception + finally test
  throw exception, handle it, make sure finally value set

consider unit testing
  exceptionhandlerresolver - build unit with public method to resolve addresses given an
    exception
    current address
    try catch blocks
